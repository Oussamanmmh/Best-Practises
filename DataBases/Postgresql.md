## PostgreSQL Transaction Isolation Levels

PostgreSQL supports the **SQL standard isolation levels**, but thanks to its robust **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** architecture, only **three distinct levels** are effectively implemented.

### Isolation Levels Comparison

| Isolation Level      | Supported in PostgreSQL      | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Read Uncommitted** | ❌ (Alias of Read Committed) | ❌          | ✅                   | ✅            |
| **Read Committed**   | ✅ _(Default)_               | ❌          | ✅                   | ✅            |
| **Repeatable Read**  | ✅                           | ❌          | ❌                   | ❌            |
| **Serializable**     | ✅                           | ❌          | ❌                   | ❌            |

### **Isolation Level Descriptions**

- **Read Uncommitted:**

  - _Not truly implemented in PostgreSQL._
  - Behaves like **Read Committed** because PostgreSQL never exposes uncommitted changes.

- **Read Committed (Default):**

  - Each query sees the latest committed data.
  - Allows **non-repeatable reads** and **phantom reads**.

- **Repeatable Read:**

  - Guarantees a **consistent snapshot** of data for the entire transaction.
  - Prevents both **non-repeatable reads** and **phantom reads**.

- **Serializable:**

  - The **strictest isolation level**.
  - Ensures complete serial execution of transactions.
  - PostgreSQL uses **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)** to prevent any concurrency anomalies.

### **How to Set Isolation Level in PostgreSQL**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

-- Your transactional queries here

COMMIT;
```

You can replace `REPEATABLE READ` with:

- `READ COMMITTED`
- `SERIALIZABLE`

To check the current isolation level:

```sql
SHOW transaction_isolation;
```

### **When to Use Higher Isolation Levels**

| Use Case                     | Recommended Isolation Level             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Financial transactions       | **Serializable**                        |
| Inventory/Reservation System | **Repeatable Read** or **Serializable** |
| Standard CRUD Applications   | **Read Committed**                      |
| Reporting/Analytics          | **Read Committed**                      |

### **MVCC in PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL's **MVCC** design ensures that:

- **Dirty reads are impossible**, even in `Read Committed`.
- Transactions remain highly concurrent without sacrificing consistency.

> For most applications, the **default isolation level (Read Committed)** is sufficient and performant.

---

### **Summary**

PostgreSQL isolation levels help balance between **data consistency** and **system performance**. Understanding when and how to use them ensures robust, reliable applications.

> Choose wisely based on your app's **consistency requirements and concurrency needs**!
